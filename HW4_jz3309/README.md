Assignment 1
In this assignmet, I chose 5 different distributions to demonstrates the LLN and CLT. Besides Normal, Possion , Binomial and Chi-squared distribution, I chose Laplace distribution which is sometims also called double exponential distribution. After calculating all 500 samples ,plot the sample mean(I set the mean 200) and fit a gaussian to the distribution of means,  I find that they all follow the two theories.

Assignment2
I download the July 2016 CitiBike data and try to test if people aged between 20 and 30 are more likely than other age groups to choose biking for commuting. I reducted the data and then split it into different age groups then plot them.

Lab4:
After download the times data for alternative bus line, I calculate the mean and sample size then plug them in the formula. The result is less than 2 sigma of the old mean which I can reject the null hypothesis.


I finish all the assignments individually but ask others some questions during the process. I lack foundation of python and finish homework help me learn many basic python skills. I will try to pair up with other classmates in next weeks.
