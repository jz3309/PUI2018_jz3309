### Hypothesis Formulation
Null and Alternate Hypothesis were formulated accurately.

I generally understand the query formulated, but perhaps it can be rephased for clarity:
Null Hypothesis: In July 2016, the proportion of people aged 20 to 30 riding Citibikes is the same or lower than the proportion of those aged 30 to 40.

### Data and Project
There was sufficient data of the number of bikers in their respective age groups, and the two graphs rendered (absolute number of bikers by age group, fraction of bikers by age group) were sufficient for the experimental set up.
A suggestion: to use consistent labelings- eg the hypothesis used the term 'proportion' - it can be used throughout instead of introducing 'fraction' as another term to point to the same analysis. 
It may be interesting to look at across a few months instead of just one month (July 2016), such that abnormalities, if any, in the data, can be nullified. 

### Appropriate test 
As the Hypothesis seeks to test the difference in two independent variables (Age Group 20-30 and Age Group 30-40), i would recommend the t-test.
