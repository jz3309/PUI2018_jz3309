## Assignment1
First, I creat a new folder HW3_jz3309 and a new file test.csv and commit the changes.

Then, I pull the file in the ADRF terminal to the folder and then use the command to remove all the file and history.

After that, I use "ls" to check the files in that folder there is only the HW1. My HW3_jz3309 folder only has the test.csv file so that folder  disappears after removing. There is no history about the file and HW3_jz3309.

## Assignment2
I download the data from nycopendata.com about the results of the SAT test of more than 300 schools. I then read the csv file with pandas.
Then I plot the data about the average reading score and average writing score. I want to know if there is some correlation between the students writing and reading abilities.
