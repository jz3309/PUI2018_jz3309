## Assignment1
First, I creat a new folder HW3_jz3309 and a new file test.csv and commit the changes.

Then, I pull the file in the ADRF terminal to the folder and then use the command to remove all the file and history.

After that, I use "ls" to check the files in that folder there is only the HW1. My HW3_jz3309 folder only has the test.csv file so that folder  disappears after removing. There is no history about the file and HW3_jz3309.

## Assignment2
I download the data from nycopendata.com on water consumption in New York City. Then I read in the data with pandas and plot it using bar chart.
For the extra credit, I use API to download a json file. The dataset is from 311request. I tranform the formatting of the created dates and then plot to see the number of complaints distribution.

For the first two assignments, I work individually.

## Assignment3
I write a python script to show the information about the given busline name and its current position.


## Assignment4
I write another python script to show the information on the next stop location of all busses of a given bus.

For the assignment 3 and 4, I did most of them myself. I mainly use google search and stack overflow to see some examples and then try to write it. But I meet a number of errors, I asked the Vaidelhei and my Tandon roomates for help.
