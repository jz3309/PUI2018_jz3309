I think Borong Lyu did a good job. The figure of Wind resouce available in California, United States shows the different resource classes distribution using data of an estimate of annual average wind resource.

CLARITY: The plot is easy to read and the quantities were visualized clearly.


ESTHETIC: The colors of the plot clearly show different claesses of wind resources and is comfortable to show what it is meant to communicate. However the table of the wind resource classes on the upper right corner is a little small compared to the scale of whole plot. It is a little bit hard to quickly present the classes of wind resources distribution.I recommend that resize the table or show it like the common legend without a table. 

HONESTY: The plot honestly reproducing the data without deforming it.
