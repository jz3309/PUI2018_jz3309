## CitibikeReview by jz3309
#### The null hypothesis and alternative hypothsis are all formulated correctly. But I think it may be formulated more clearly by adding "including age of 40" to the null hypothesis following the words"under 40 years old".
#### The data was properly pre-poccessed to extract the needed values and has the appropriate features to answer the question.
#### To test the null hypothesis, I think we can choose z-test to see if there is significant difference between young and elder riders willing to ride citibikes.
#### To make the study more interesting,  what about adding more years' data to see if young people are more willing to ride bikes in recent years or if the difference between two groups stay the same? 
#### Above are my suggestions and comments.
