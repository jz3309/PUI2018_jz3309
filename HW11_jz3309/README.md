Assignment1:
I individually finished most of the assgiment1 but ask Siddanhanth for help in the task3 building the model by random forest and how to do the normalization.

Assigment2:
To improve my plot, I investigated the population density in these areas to find there are more accidents in areas where a lot of people
live. I also changed continuous color scheme to using bins to assign color.
