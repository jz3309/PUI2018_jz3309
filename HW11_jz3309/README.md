# HW11_jz3309
## Assignment1:
I individually finished first two tasks in the assgiment1. For task3, I asked Siddanhanth for help about building the model by random forest and how to do the normalization. But I still feel confused and haven't finished that part.

## Assigment2:
To improve my plot, I investigated the population density in these areas to find there are more accidents in areas where a lot of people
live. I also changed continuous color scheme to using bins to assign color.
